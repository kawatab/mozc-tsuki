 Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST),
 the copyright holders, disclaims all warranties with regard to this
 software, including all implied warranties of merchantability and
 fitness, in no event shall NAIST be liable for

 .
 A large portion of the dictionary entries
 originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
 Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
 .
 Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
 original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
 that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
 on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
 in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
 distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
 contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
 jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
 research and development conducted during the project and is provided
 to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
 program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
 implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
 includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
 performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
 the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
 any right of any third party.
 .
 Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
 have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
 the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
 otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
 .
 Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
 organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
 development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
 officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
 damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
 and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
 with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
 or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
 regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
 knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
 project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
 foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
 "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
 modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
 production of secondary products from the program.
 .
 In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
 modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
 any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
 grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
 writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
 from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
 above as far as the program is concerned.
